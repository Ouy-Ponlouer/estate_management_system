//============ Noted to improve urself ==============//

- it's wrong port but still waste time
- Make secure database with place and password_hash()
- Not sure with if else endif $SESSION syntax
- when we call Variable and define PHP 
- header syntax
- call SESSION_START() redirect when login already, add condiction PHP_SESSION_NONE, session_status
- include header after process PHP end 

// =========== props ================//
- $stmt= $con->prepare($sql); //  sends your SQL to the database and prepares a statement ($stmt) you can use to get the results.
- $stmt->execute();   // executes the prepared SQL query. we use it with prepare()
- if u want to use query u don't have to use execute()


// ================= FETCH_ASSOC VS FETCH_OBJ ==================//

- FETCH_ASSOC and FETCH_OBJ are two different ways to fetch rows from a database query result. Here's the difference:
  FETCH_ASSOC:Fetches the result as an associative array
  ➔ You access data like $row['column_name'].  example property-detail.php

  FETCH_OBJ:Fetches the result as an object.
   ➔ You access data like $row->column_name.

- $props = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // fetch one row -> $props['column_name'].
- $props = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // fetch all row ->$props->column_name

- var_dump("$props"); // used for echo all arrys or objects 

//=========== What that I didn't finish ====================//

- I didn't finish search router
- propery detail seem like wrong logic 
- add more feature like when click detial route to login 
- Delete Fav like wrong logic


// ================= DATABASE Noted ===================//

- PDO (PHP Data Objects):
  ➔ It's a database access layer in PHP that lets you connect to many different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) using the same code style.
  ➔ It's flexible and safer (supports prepared statements easily

- MySQLi (MySQL Improved):
  ➔ It’s a specific PHP extension just for MySQL databases.
  ➔ It also supports prepared statements, but only works with MySQL.

- JOIN Table in favorite.php

- Noted syntax '$name'  ->  WHERE home_type = '$name'  ";
- Assecc as array syntax ->  WHERE home_type= '".$detail["home_type"]."'"; 

// ==================  MORE RESEARCH Syntax=====================//

- propery-detail : echo "<script>window.location.href='".base_url."/property-details.php?id=$prop_id' </script>";
- Syntaxt :  WHERE prop_id='$id' AND user_id ='".$_SESSION["id"]."'"; 
                                                                        user_id='$_SESSION[id]'   ";        // noted syntax
                                                                        user_id={$_SESSION['id']} ";
                                                                        user_id=" . $_SESSION['id'];
